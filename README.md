This repository contains a collection of very basic HTML-only projects created for learning and practice. Each project is simple, self-contained, and built using only HTML (some with inline CSS and JS).

## 🧩 Included Projects

A basic static layout for the classic "Connect Four" game built in raw HTML. (Game logic not included.)

### 3. 🛍️ E-commerce Webpage (`ecommerce.html`)
